__NO LONGER MAINTAINED__

This smart package packs [jsPlump][1] for Meteor.

    jsPlumb provides a means for a developer to visually connect elements on their web pages. It uses SVG or Canvas in modern browsers, and VML on IE 8 and below.

See [original package][1] for documentation and the [demo page][2].
